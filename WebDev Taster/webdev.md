#Â 1 Day WebDev Course
final folder contains what the end product should look like:
- I plan to just give the html & css, but I have added the js versions as well so you know what the 2 day session changes are :) 

Going through homepage folder first:
    - *learners will use just 1 index file and one stylesheet, I have separated them to show what I'm doing when*
    - index1.html --> semantic.css --> index2.html --> semantic.css
    - index3.html --> navbar.css

Then rps folder:
    - rps1.html: duplicating index.html
    - rps2.html & rps.css: styling images, using flexbox for complex layouts and intro classes
    - rps3.html & rps.css: complete layout & intro styling an id.
