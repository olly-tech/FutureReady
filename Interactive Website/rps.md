#Â 2 Day WebDev Course - Interactive Website
Day 1 is following the WebDev Taster folder, then move into this folder for JavaScript on Day 2

At the end of Day 1, I will give them the code in the final folder in WebDev Taster.
final folder in Interactive Website contains what the end product should look like.

In the teaching folder, we will flip between the intro.js + intro2.js. 
    - intro.js: teaching demos
    - intro2.js: the RPS activities they will do separated out. They will make theirs in rps.js
    - rpslogic.txt: shows the logic I will be teaching and also following through as we go through the complete rps.js
